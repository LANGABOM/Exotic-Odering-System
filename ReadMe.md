## Problem Statement

As an entrepreneur of sells food as a vendor at events, I always face challengies and taking orders from customers and manage those orders in time. Also sometimes i missplace the orders or confuse the orders. The chef always complain that i dont communicate the oders properly it get confusing with the chefs. The chefs also sometimes put wrong ingrediates to the order.

Another challege is that managing revenues and sales is difficult. I sometimes dont see profit or commisions made after selling at the end of the event. its very difficult to identify key eareas where i can improve financially

Also i need a visual representation of profiy margis and committions per periods
